                After spending some time in NYC with some of my close friends, I realized that I had this urge to explore other cities. I'd alaways imagined traveling, but didn't really know where I wanted to go or how I was gonig to do it. When my best friend decided to teach english in Spain, seeing all his amazing pictures really made me realize that I needed to do some research. After lots of YouTube videos and google searches. I knew Italy was the place for me. From the beaches, to the food, and the amazing art, I knew this would be a perfect place to spend my summer.

                Venice was by far my favorite city. From the water taxis cruising by, to seeing art students indulge in their projects, the amazing beauty of Venetian homes, Venice was an unforgettable experience.
